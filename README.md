# Dynamic Characterization Of Structures

Dynamic characterization of structures using the digital accelerometer ADXL345 on a Raspberry Pi 3.

2 Python Codes.

NOTE: - adxl345.py was taken from https://github.com/pimoroni/adxl345-python/blob/master/adxl345.py and modified to achieve the goals of this proyect.

      - adx.py use the class created in adxl345.py but was done by me.
